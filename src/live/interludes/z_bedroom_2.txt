Inside the desk is a notebook, in modern paper, just like the ones that you have at home. On one of the corners of the desk, a pen and a sharpened pencil. Opening one of the pages at random, you realize that it is mostly empty. You rapidly go through the pages backwards, and what you find then is shocking. Your own full name is written on the first page!

As you start to realize what that meant, you swiftly reach for the door and out of the room, only to find that the hallway that you came from had been replaced by a wall.
There was no way out of the fortress.
