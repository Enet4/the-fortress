"I sense that you like this place." the same voice reemerges, only this time coming from somewhere in the room, without the imponent aggression and echoing reverberation. However, you do not see the wizard anywhere in the room.

"Why are you so eager to see me?" the voice continues. "Why don't you look in the mirror?"

You turn your attention to a corner of the room next to the large windows, where a tall mirror stands. You walk toward the mirror and stand in front of it.
