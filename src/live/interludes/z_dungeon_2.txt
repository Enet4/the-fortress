Before you could anticipate, you hear a large grunt. Two red glowing eyes emerge in the darkness, staring directly at you. The creature approaches you, revaling that it is large, unshackled, with clear signs of undernutrition. The grunts turn into heavy growls, as the creature realizes that you may put an end to its hunger.

Cold sweat drips down your forehead. You are completely unprepared for fighting this monster, yet your immense fear has immobilized you. You are afraid to turn around and be pounced from the back before you have the change to flee.
