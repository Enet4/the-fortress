After an exhausting challenge of wits and quick thinking, you reach a new, astonishing chamber. Behind the white double doors is a colorful living room, decorated with impressive paintings on the walls, carpets with intricate patterns, finely crafted chairs, and silver candlesticks on white cotton sheets. Two large windowed doors would provide access to a balcony, no doubt with a great view of the land. A fireplace burns delightfully before a round table with the local newspaper.

You think that this is too good to be true.
